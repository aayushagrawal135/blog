Hi there, thanks for dropping by!

I am first year Masters student in Computer Science at New York University, Courant. I completed my Bachelors in Information & Communication Technology from DAIICT.

It seems that majority of the posts would be centered around math or computer science, which is why I chose fastpages to build my blog on (Kudos to the fastpages team). However, I like to get familiar with sports, MELA, history and economics as well. I want to read about them more and I am looking forward to a write about them from myself.
